	 OOP Encapsulation
	 	1. private access modifier
	 	2. getter & setter
	 	3. multi-class
	 	
	 OOP: Object Oriented Programming
	 
	 class:
	 	data/attribute ==> instance variables
	 	
	 	Actions ==> instance method
	 	
	 	instance variable: belongs to the object each object has a copy of its own
	 	of the instance variable
	 	
	 	Encapsulation: to hide the instance variable (hiding data)
	 	1. hiding the data by giving private access modifier
	 	2. grants other classes get access the private data using public getter & setter
	 	
	 	getter (Read Only): an instance method that returns the private data
	 			does not pass any parameter
	 		
	 		the return type of the method has to match the return type of 
	 		the private instance variable
	 		access modifier needs to be public
	 		
	 	setter (Modify): 
	 	
	 	private: if the feature is private, the feature is only visible
	 	within the class
	 	codes outside the class cannot access the data
	 	not accessible from other classes
