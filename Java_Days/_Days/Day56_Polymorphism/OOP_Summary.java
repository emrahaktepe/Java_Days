/*
 		OOP: Object Oriented Programming
 		
 		1. Encapsulation: data hiding by giving private access modifier
	 		to the variables, and provide public getter/setter
	 		
	 		benefits:	control the data condition
	 					Data security
	 		
	 		if the private data is final we can only generate getter
	 	
	 	2. Inheritance:	sub & super relationship. methods & variables 
	 	of one class can be inherited to another		sub ==> super
	 	
	 		benefits:	reusable
	 					easy to maintain
	 					more organized
	 					
	 	3. Abstraction:	hiding the implementation. concentrating on the 
	 	importance/essentials without worrying about the details
	 	
	 		2 ways to achieve abstraction:
	 			1. Abstract class
	 			2. Interface
	 		
	 		benefits:	reusability
	 					able to focus on what to do instead of how to do
	 					
	 	4. Polymorphism: object behavior in many forms.
	 	 				super class/interface can be reference type to any
	 	 				child class' objects
	 	 				
	 	 	benefits: 	flexible
	 	 				one single variable with reference type of parent class
	 	 				is able to any objects of child class
